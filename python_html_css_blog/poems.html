                <p><h4>Crow</h4></p>

                Dark the color cawing all the way<br>
                Having fear travelling around a place<br>
                Seeking no help from any human at all<br>
                A crow I see at my roof; standing tall.<br><br>

                I see it wet because of the rain<br>
                When I go close, it chooses another lane<br>
                My cane is too slow for him I know<br>
                But he still fears me the dark colored crow<br><br>

                Many years have passed but he's still the same<br>
                Even same is his the famous black name<br>
                But my life has changed me this day<br>
                So all I have is the crows to play.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p id = "happy birthday">
                <p><h4>Happy Birthday</h4></p>
                Have you ever wondered, if<br>
                All the stars shone at once?<br>
                People would go blinded at once<br>
                People would go crazy at once, but<br>
                You would still shine the most.<br><br>

                Before this happiness could vanish<br>
                I will always remember you<br>
                Reading my old poems<br>
                Turning the old pages, again.<br>
                Hope that you would still remember me, like<br>
                Days of summer for bumblebees<br>
                And nights of wonder for all the seas, and<br>
                Yes, the butterflies that you give.<br><br>

                A boy still thinks about you, though<br>
                Many months have gone so silent.<br>
                I have no words to keep but<br>
                To think of what we could be<br>
                All the same, or a little different.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p id = "god">
                <p><h4>God?</h4></p>
                If someone could explain to me<br>
                Why I was born this way<br>
                If someone could tell me<br>
                Why we count life in days<br>
                If anyone could handle me<br>
                From all those misery haze<br>
                Then I would make my life<br>
                The life that everyone would gaze<br>
                In the limitless sky<br>
                With a hope to find himself<br>
                And just to give it a try<br>
                If really the one that made him<br>
                Exists in the palace of clouds<br>
                At which we frequently shout<br>
                To our supreme belief I guess<br>
                Has provided us nothing but less<br>
                Lesser than an ant, a sloth<br>
                The peace of mind and heart on earth<br>
                The one that cannot be explained<br>
                In the language of physics<br>
                In the language of literature<br>
                Even we know the failure<br>
                Of mathematics<br>
                To know what's there in and beyond<br>
                The infinity, the divinity, the trinity<br>
                There's no answer to everything<br>
                If someone could explain me<br>
                What is god?<br>
            </p>
            <p id = "I miss you">
              <p><h4>I miss you</h4> </p>
              the ring goes on and on, you dont receive<br>
              but i know the network would never deceive<br>
              either you listen to the voice mails i sent<br>
              or you see my missed calls, which are unseen<br>
              you pretend.<br><br> 

              you take your pictures, you do edit them sometimes<br>
              but you dont need no edits, cuz your face got the perfect rhymes<br>
              a poet would never unnotice the glamour pass by<br>
              his best poems would just break away, cuz they were all<br> 
              just lies<br><br>

              the melody of your ringtone is i know something you love<br>
              and you know i hate the calling sound but i can't make it stop<br>
              i wonder if you see my name on the top of your contact lists<br>
              or at the bottom or nowhere; like a dew lost into<br>
              the mist<br><br>

            <p id = "I miss you... dear">
              <p><h4>I miss you....dear</h4></p>

              Come let's swing by the old songs that we listened to<br>
              Come let's rejoice the old memories that we can remember<br>
              Come let's walk on the pavements that are still the same<br>
              Come let's build up the promises that we made for ever.<br><br>

              Come let's sing with our ugly voices once again<br>
              Come let's make jokes and make people mad again<br>
              Come let's fool around our small town once again<br>
              Come let's talk and keep on talking time and again.<br><br>
              Come let's simplify the life problems that we go through<br>
              Come let's hang on the happiness that we loved back then<br>
              Come let's make magic happen when its pitch dark<br>
              Come let's rewire our brains and go insanely insane.<br><br>

              Come let's throw pebbles on the pond and river nearby<br>
              Come let's count the stars and forget the counting<br>
              Come let's watch the green leaves turn brown and green again<br>
              Come let's forget about the dead and think about living.<br><br>

              But i know<br>
              The things written above<br>
              Would never come true.<br>
              I miss you dear<br>
              Where are you?<br><br>

            दिनभरी<br>
            चिन्ता गर्दै,<br> 
            धिक्कार मान्दै, <br>
            समयको गतिलाई सराप्दै,<br> 
            आजकल दिन भर्दो रहेछ। <br>
            बितेका सुनौला पल सम्झदै <br>
            खाएका कसमहरु केलाउदै <br>
            भिजेका सपनाहरु सुकाउदै <br>

            माया लाएका कुराहरु गनगनाउदै<br>
            आफ्नै सायालाई आँफैले पछ्याउदै <br>
            सही र गलतलाई छुत्याउदै <br>

            आइन्स्ताइनलाई सही तुल्याउदै <br>
            पिक्कासोको जय गुणगान गाउदै <br>
            नारायण गोपाललाई सम्झाउदै <br>
            आजकल दिन भर्दो रहेछ।<br>
            पुराना पुस्तकहरु थन्काउदै <br>
            नयाँ लुगाहरु लगाउदै <br>
            आँफैलाई आफु आत्मसमर्पन गर्दै<br> 
            आजकल दिन भर्दो रहेछ।<br><br>
