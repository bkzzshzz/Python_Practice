          <p><em>Unplanned trips are the best, 'cause planned trips never happen.</em></p>
          <p>This gallery, for now, features an unplanned trip to Chovar with my friends from the engineering days - Madhav and Kaveer. It was totally uncalled for, and I was the only one with a phone that had charge and a camera. The phone was Nokia X.</p>
          <p>The two guys are busy discussing about mathematics and physics while I held the product of the those two disciplines of sciences and took a picture of them.

                Madhav, here, was explaing about how the lines show the millions and millions of sedimentaion of soil and the slanted lines on the cliff nearby depicts the effect of earthquakes.
