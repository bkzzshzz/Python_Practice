<h1>Greetings!</h1>
<p>This is <del>Bikash</del> Bikesh Shrestha and it's my blog you're heartily welcomed into. This is a place I
keep tabs on my programming journey and also a place to safekeep whatever literary works I have done so far.
Although inadequate(as I lost so many of my works in the flow of time), i have tried to showcase my works in as
presentable format as possible. This blog also features some book reviews of the books i have read so far. With
more books to be read, I am sure it will add up more to the review page. Also, there's gallery and the
programming journey section with my complete CV.</p>
<p>Since this is the title webpage of my blog, there is a need for an introduction.</p>
<p>Again and I promise you the last time I am saying my name, I am Bikesh Shrestha. I hail from a small town
called Barhabise which is in Sindhupalchowk district. I have my dad, my mom and a younger brother in the family.
I completed my entire school years(from nursery to Grade 10) from Ketu Secondary School(then Ketu English
Boarding School). The high school years passed in VS Niketan HSS. Then, I went on to Thapathali Campus for my
Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Degree(which I am still pursuing). I haven't given a pinch of
thought as to what future prospects for my academics will be, but I do have undivided passion to science. I hope
I achieve something in this field.</p>
<p>Now, I will provide you with the details of the several pages within this blog.</p>
<p>In <em>poems</em> section, there are quite a few of my feautured poems. Most of the poems were written about a
year ago. I actually haven't written much in recent times. It's not that I don't have any interest in writing
whatsover or I have given up on writing, but I simple haven't given much time into writing. I mean, writing is a
difficult task to begin with. One has to be in a certain state of mind to actually write anything that can have
any meaning or sense. One simple doesn't sit and write. No way,Jose! There is a need for solace and solitude
while writing.<br>
My poems range in all different topics: from love and romances to nature and philosophy, and from nature and
philosophy to mathematics and daily lives. I sometimes tend to touch some aspects of history and warn about the
mistakes that happened back then so that the same thing won't happen again.<br>
My poems are for people aged more than 14. Not that they have any <abbr title="Not Safe For Work">NSFW</abbr> or
any 18+ materials but one has to gain some experience in life to actually understand what the words try to
convey.
</p>
<p>
In the <em>gallery</em> section, as the name suggests, you can find pictures. Since, <em>picture</em>
encompasses a whole range of different entities, this section may not have a specific genre but will definitely
have an orderly stacking of picures under certain headings.<br>
The pictures could be quotes, or my photography endeavors(one of my hobbies) or just with friends. But, yes, a
blog is incomplete without any means of visual from the blogger so there you have it.<br>
</p>
<p>My favorite part - the <a href="book_reviews.html"><em>book-reviews</em></a> section! I read. I guess that
would suffice for you to know my love for books. I haven't read much non-fiction books, though. So, all you will
see are the reviews of fiction books.<br>
The love of reading comes from the joy of reading. You get to experience the ebbs and flows of fictional
characters described by words, you have to guess their appearance, things happening to them and the characters
around them with just words. This, I insist, gives you way more freedom than watching the visual rendition of
the same thing as the movies and series want us to bound us to their own adaptation of the ideas that they have.
But the time it's taken to complete a book is long, which I believe is a ying-yang part of reading â€” a yang
because it can become tiresome and a movie or series could show us in far less time than read the whole book; a
ying because we get to spend more time in the realm of the characters, which is a good thing for any person that
loves dwelling on the fiction. </p>
<p>The <a href="programming_journey.html"><em>programming journey</em></a> part records the beginning of my
programming journey which in fact started way before, but was completely left at bay for a decade. So, here I am
revisiting my love for prgramming, and hopefully making real progress. Lots to learn, lots to earn.</p>
<p>The last bit is <a href="my_cv.html"><em>my CV</em></a> part. And that's all there to it.</p>
